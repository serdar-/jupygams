# Working with GAMS using Jupyter Notebook 
Mostly you need to run GAMS from terminal/command prompt or GAMS IDE. However, afterwards you need to transfer your results to another environment to analyze them. Purpose of this notebook is to show how you can run GAMS and analyze the resulting data using Jupyter Notebook. 

## Requirements 
In order to run all the cells in the notebook, you need to have GAMS installed in your computer first. Path of the GAMS executable should be in the path of your system (i.e. you should be able to run GAMS using terminal/command prompt). Also, for reading the results from GDX files, you need to have [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [gdxpds](https://github.com/NREL/gdx-pandas) installed. gdxpds requires [GAMS Python API](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/API_PY_TUTORIAL.html) to be installed.
